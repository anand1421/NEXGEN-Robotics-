Robotic arms modules powered by custom smart sockets 


Summary of NexGen Robotics: The Future of Modular Home Automation
Vision
NexGen Robotics is on a mission to revolutionize household automation by creating cost-effective, portable, and modular robotic solutions powered by our proprietary smart socket system. Our ultimate goal is to redefine how people interact with robotics in everyday life, making automated assistance accessible and indispensable to households around the world.

The Product
Our flagship innovation lies in the synergy between modular robotic arm-like modules and custom smart sockets. The smart sockets are the cornerstone of our design, delivering both power and data seamlessly to the attached modules. The sockets also enable interchangeability, ensuring that households can use a wide variety of robotic modules for diverse tasks without needing a complete system overhaul.

Key Features:

Custom Smart Sockets:

Provide power and data connectivity.
Act as the foundation for the modular robotic ecosystem.
Designed to become a universal standard for future modular robotics.
Robotic Arm Modules:

Modular, portable, and compact design.
Targeted to handle repetitive household chores such as:
Loading and unloading dishwashers.
Washing and folding clothes.
Cutting vegetables and preparing meals.
Upgradable hardware with interchangeable modules for task-specific optimization.
Software-Driven Upgrades:

AI-powered learning and task optimization through reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning.
Continuous updates via software upgrades to enhance task efficiency and expand capabilities.
Why Modular Robotics?
The modularity of our system allows consumers to customize their robotic assistants based on individual needs and household demands. This flexibility and affordability set us apart from traditional robotic solutions, which are often expensive, bulky, and limited in functionality. By focusing on modularity, we address three key consumer pain points: cost, versatility, and upgradability.

The Market Need
Through our market research, including surveys of over 200 households, we identified a strong demand for automation in mundane household tasks. Over 85% of respondents expressed enthusiasm for affordable modular robotics. With 48.6 million middle-class, upper-middle-class, and upper-class households in the U.S., our addressable market is substantial.

Technology Stack
Our system integrates state-of-the-art hardware and software components to deliver a seamless user experience:

Hardware:

Custom 6-DoF robotic arms powered by Dynamixel-P series motors.
Sensors, including Intel RealSense cameras and tactile/force sensors, for environment interaction.
Embedded NVIDIA Jetson computers for onboard processing.
Software:

ROS 2 as the core framework for robot operation.
Motion planning and control through a custom low-latency distributed system.
Machine learning models built with TensorFlow, RLlib, and scikit-learn.
Simulation and testing in Isaac Sim.
Mobile Application:

Swift-based app for easy robot management and control.
Cloud integration via AWS for data storage and updates.
Progress and Development
We are currently in the prototyping phase, actively developing:

A functional robotic module integrated with the smart socket system.
